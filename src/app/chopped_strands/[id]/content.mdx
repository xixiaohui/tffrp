# Glass Fiber Chopped Strands Technical Data Sheet (TDS)

Glass Fiber Chopped Strands are high-performance reinforcement materials made by cutting continuous glass filaments into short lengths. They are designed for use in thermoplastics and thermosetting resins to improve mechanical properties such as tensile strength, dimensional stability, and thermal resistance.

## Features & Advantages

- **Excellent mechanical reinforcement** — enhances tensile, flexural, and impact strength  
- **Fast resin wet-out** — ensures homogenous dispersion during processing  
- **Good flowability and feeding behavior** — suitable for extrusion and injection molding  
- **Low static buildup and low fuzz** — improved cleanliness in compounding  
- **Corrosion and thermal resistant** — ideal for harsh operating conditions  
- **Electrical insulation** — stable dielectric properties over a wide frequency range  

## Processing Methods

Chopped strands are used in a variety of molding and compounding methods:

- **Injection Molding** — for automotive parts, home appliances, and power tools  
- **Extrusion Compounding** — production of reinforced pellets or masterbatch  
- **Compression Molding** — suitable for high-strength structural composites  
- **Hand Lay-up (in thermosets)** — for reinforcement in putties, adhesives, and resins  

## Typical Applications

- Automotive: engine covers, battery trays, interior panels  
- Electrical & Electronics: switch boxes, insulators, cable trays  
- Appliances: washing machine panels, housings  
- Industrial: pump housings, gratings, machine parts  
- Construction: reinforced concrete additives, FRP rebars  
- Marine: boat fittings, compound profiles  

## Storage & Handling

- Store in a **dry, cool, and ventilated** environment  
- Avoid **direct sunlight, moisture, and excessive stacking**  
- Recommended temperature: **15–35°C**; RH < 65%  
- Use within **12 months** of manufacture for optimal performance  
- After opening, seal bags tightly to avoid moisture pickup  

## Packaging

- **PE-lined kraft paper bags**, 20–25 kg net weight  
- Optional **big bag packaging** for bulk use (500–1000 kg)  
- Delivered on **fumigated wooden pallets** with shrink-wrap protection

## Quality Assurance

All chopped strand batches are tested against international standards:

- Moisture and LOI verification  
- Fiber length consistency & dispersion tests  
- Sizing compatibility & resin wet-out testing  
- Ash content and bulk density measurement  
- Mechanical property retention in composite matrix
